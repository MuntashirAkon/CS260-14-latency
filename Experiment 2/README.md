# Experiment 2

## Extracting the zip files

As each file is greater than 100 MB, it wasn't possible to upload them without
using GitHub LFS. Each zip file compressed using 7z and splitted into two
parts. To extract the zip files, 7z or similar software must be used. Default
zip viewer in macOS may fail to open the files.
